Hey guys I've spoken with Aileen and these are the requirements for the presentation.
1.Introduction:A working project title/ possibly a drawing on how our game would look.
2.Overview of project proposal: Research objectives/ a short description about our game.
3.Background to the project:Why we choose this particular project / research completed(we can leave this out or just say we looked at previous sfml games for inspiration.).
4.Proposed Technical approach:What technologies we are going to use to implement our game on and why (PC/mobile etc.).
5.Project Management:How the project will be managed(we are using agile - urd diagrams etc.).
6.Team Management:Members of the team, how the team will be managed, communication mechanisms(meetings/online), shared work repositories(Submarine Mayhem github), team roles, team charter.
>The presentation is around 15mins long.
>Aileen also don't want the powerpoint to be too long I would say maybe we should do max 2 slides on each topic?
>She said diagrams and images would be nice.
>I'm still thinking if we should add a epic 2014 intro XD.
>This powerpoint is due next Tuesday.

Let me know if this looks ok.
